Signals and Systems Sessional (AVE 4510) - MATLAB Code Repository


This repository hosts the MATLAB scripts and simulation files developed during the Signals and Systems Sessional (AVE 4510) course that I attended in my 5th semester. The aim of this repository is to archive, share, and document the various scripts and Simulink models utilized throughout the course.

Course Objectives

1. Equip students with skills in modeling and simulation methodologies.
2. Provide training on the application of various loops in MATLAB and the use of Simulink.
3. Validate simulation results through practical tests.


Course Outcomes (CO):
1. Demonstrate proficiency in utilizing MATLAB and simulation tools.
2. Develop effective simulation models using MATLAB/Simulink.
3. Solve engineering problems with MATLAB and COMSOL software.
